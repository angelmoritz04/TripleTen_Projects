## Overview

<p> The following analysis was made to determine which property types (location, size, neighborhood, etc.) make for the highest return on investment, and estimate the revenue that could be earned from these investments </p>

## Features & Functionality

- Raw data has been cleaned to accurately reflect reviews, ratings, sizes of the Airbnb properties, and more
- I created several pivot tables to sort properties and reflect what neighborhoods might give the best return on investment
- Graphs are also available to reflect the findings in a more aesthetically engaging manner

## Findings of the Analysis

- I determined that the **Lower East Side** was the most profitable district in New York City, drawing in over 6,000 reviews over the past 12 months.
- It became obvious through the organization that 1-bedroom properties were the most popular by far, with 50% of clients choosing a 1-bedroom property over any other number of rooms
